Thanks to this information, it never writes past the output buffer.\n         However, since it doesn't know its 'src' size, it may read an unknown amount of input, past input buffer bounds.\n         Also, since match offsets are not validated, match reads from 'src' may underflow too.\n         These issues never happen if input (compressed) data is correct.\n         But they may happen if input data is invalid (error or intentional tampering).\n         As a consequence, use these functions in trusted environments with trusted data **only**."]
